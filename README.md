This is a recreate of the mweather include by SA-MP forum user [Mauzen](http://forum.sa-mp.com/member.php?u=10237).

It should be noted that while I call this a recreate, it is only a recreate of the idea mweather originally introduced; which were weather zones that get real-life weather data.

## Installation

Simply install to your project:

```bash
sampctl package install Cezear/a_weather
```

Include in your code and begin using the library:

```pawn
#include <a_weather>
```

## Usage

For usage instructions, view the [Wiki](https://github.com/Cezear/a_weather/wiki)

## Testing
